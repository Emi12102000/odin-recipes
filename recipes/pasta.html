    <img src="/home/emi/repos/odin-recipes/img/pasta.jpg" alt="pasta" height="310" width="310">
    <p>This Sunday Pasta recipe is dedicated to Veronica.  We will call it "Veronica's favorite" and along with it we will wish her a very happy birthday!</p>
    <p>The pasta can be baked into a crusty-edged winter day's dish, or can be served on just-cooked pasta.  Try any pasta, but penne seems to be the standard.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb penne rigate</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 oz mascarpone</li>
        <li>4 oz. gorgonzola dolce (grated or chopped into small cubes)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 oz fontina (grated or chopped into small cubes)</li>
        <li>4 oz. Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a sauce pan on medium heat, melt the butter into the heavy cream</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted, add the other cheeses and stir until they are melted together</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, boil the water and cook the pasta until 1 minute shy of al dente</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and add to the sauce pan. Cook for 1 minute</li>
            <li>stirring until pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve, and sprinkle with parmigiano, salt and pepper to taste. Best to serve in warm bowls so the cheese sauce stays warm.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
